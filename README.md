# Matomo TheFamousSnakeHouse Theme

## Description

I created this theme for fun only. I was writing a book about how to develop themes within Matmo and I got this idea of playing with Harry Potter fonts.
So, I asked to ChatGPT to generate some styles and it appears that the one of Slytherin was giving a readable result. So I just ask myself, ok, why not indexing it on the Matomo marketplace.

## How is this theme working?

This is the first theme that I indexed on the marketplace, so it is very minimalistic. I just listed the variables I needed within the theme.less file and then I asked ChatGPT to adapt those colors to the topic I wanted.

## Support

I am not providing any direct support, but I wrote a book about it that you can have a look at in order to tweak the theme to your wishes.
